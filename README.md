Notes on how prototypes and prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript/ES5

Since I can never remember how exactly JavaScript's prototypes and prototypal inheritance work, I finally created this cheat sheet.
To check it out, view the file [src/app.js](src/app.js).
To run the example code, do `npm install && npm run-script all`.
Then, follow the instructions specified in [src/app.js](src/app.js) on how to un-comment the section you want to run.

This repository is based on [js-boilerplate](https://github.com/jsfanboy/js-boilerplate).
The cheat sheet was originally based on chapters 4 and 5 of [Nicholas Zakas](https://twitter.com/slicknet)'s book [The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/oopinjavascript).
